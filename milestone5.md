Scenaria:

Our target users are companies/organizations who are seeking YouTubers to promote their products on YouTube channel. On our website, a target user will be able to search YouTubers by their names and channel categories. If the user wants to promote a sport product, he/she cann search "Sports" and get a list of YouTubers who have the greatest number of subscribers. The user can also sort searching results by setting the maximum number of subscribers. Since the bigger number of subscribers is, the more expensive will the promotion be, the user can find YouTubers who provide promotion at a price the user can afford. By clicking on each YouTuber, the user is able to see more details about the YouTuber, such as channel description and the link to the channel, which depending on the YouTuber, can provide the user with the YouTuber's contact information. The user can also save YouTubers he/she intends to connect with to his/her collection.

Data Display Explaination:


Ambitious data display or visualization ideas:

For data display and visualization, we are satisfied with the current list by number of subscribers but we are hoping we could sort the data and list them out using more information to show protential Youtubers but it is hard to find such data, we would need to do some analysis with current data in order to achieve that. As for the Youtuber detail page, it is now displaying Youtuber name, category, number of followers, discription of their channel, link to their channel and the button to save it to personal list. We would hope to display a lot more detailed information in this page like showing their so far most views video and showing them so far most liked videos also since when the channel has been created as well as their recent month follower changing trend to better discribe a channel for our user to evaluate their potential business value.
