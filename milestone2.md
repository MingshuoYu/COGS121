Explanation of difference between screenshots and paper prototypes:

  Compared to the paper prototype in the milestone 1, we made lots of changes. Our design of the frontend relies on the second prototype. The main change is that we changed the page format from mobile version to the PC version. We think there are more people to use the PC version of the app because both businessman or youtuber spend more time on the computer instead of the phone and they need larger space to get more information. The other changes are mostly about the page layout. Due to the page format change, we changed the page layout to fit into our new design.
